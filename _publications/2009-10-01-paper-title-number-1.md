excerpt: 'In this project, I studied the frequency and variation of word order in Russian and English by combining linguistic theory with computational analysis. I focused on short declarative sentences (up to ten words) and analyzed over 100 examples from each language using Python-based tools like spaCy and pymorphy2. My goal was to understand how different word orders function syntactically and what linguistic factors - such as theme and rheme, emphasis, or information structure - might influence them. While English generally follows a fixed Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order, Russian allows for greater flexibility, which often reflects pragmatic nuances. This research highlights how syntax interacts with meaning and context, offering insights for comparative linguistics, translation, and language teaching.
As part of this project in the future, I plan to develop an interactive map-based interface where users can click on individual words or short sentences to view the regions in which these expressions are most frequently used. This web-based tool will visualize the frequency of word order patterns and syntactic constructions across different areas, providing both linguistic insights and an accessible way to explore regional variation in language use.'

Understanding how word order works in different languages can reveal a lot about how we structure thoughts, highlight information, and communicate meaning. In this project, I explored how Russian and English handle word order differently - and what those differences tell us about each language's grammar and use.
English tends to stick to a fixed Subject–Verb–Object (SVO) structure, while Russian allows for much more flexibility. In Russian, you might move parts of a sentence around to highlight what's new or important, or to match the rhythm of speech. That freedom, however, still follows certain syntactic and pragmatic rules - and that’s what I wanted to understand better.

By combining linguistic theory with computational analysis, this research sheds light on how structure and meaning work together in both languages. It’s especially relevant for anyone interested in comparative linguistics, translation, or language teaching. It also shows how NLP tools can support traditional linguistic research and help analyze patterns at scale.
