I created a bilingual chatbot using the Rasa framework to help users practice English and Russian sentence structure. The bot guides users in building grammatically correct sentences by offering feedback on word order—one of the trickiest aspects for language learners. It’s designed as an interactive tool to make learning more intuitive and engaging, especially for those struggling with syntax in either language. No machine translation—just real-time dialogue and smart suggestions based on rule-based NLP and linguistic analysis. The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/thecognicode/Rasa-EN-RU-chatbot).
