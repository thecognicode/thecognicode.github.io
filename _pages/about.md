üéì I‚Äôm currently studying Computational Linguistics in a Professional Retraining Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) in Moscow.

üß† My research interests lie at the intersection of linguistics and artificial intelligence, with a focus on syntactic structures, word order in English and Russian, and building educational NLP tools using conversational AI.

ü§ñ I‚Äôm currently working on a research project that involves building a conversational AI using Rasa, designed to help users learn and practice word order in English and Russian through interactive dialogue. This combines linguistic analysis with NLP tools and user-centered design.

üåç With a background in translation studies, computational linguistics, and participation in United Nations projects related to GIS and cartography, I am particularly interested in interdisciplinary approaches that integrate linguistic theory, technological applications, and educational practice.
Selected experience
I have published a paper in the Molodoy Ucheny (Young Scientist) academic journal, available at moluch.ru.

üìú Rule-Based Linguistic Analysis with Python
With a strong foundation in linguistics and computational analysis, I have independently conducted research combining syntactic analysis and computational tools. One of my recent projects involved analyzing the frequency of word orders in Russian and English using Python-based NLP libraries such as spaCy, pymorphy2, and NLTK. I performed in-depth syntactic parsing and designed scripts to extract and compare linear word order patterns from bilingual corpora.
As part of this work, I wrote an academic article titled ‚Äú–ß–∞—Å—Ç–æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–æ—Ä—è–¥–∫–æ–≤ —Å–ª–æ–≤ –≤ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º –∏ –∞–Ω–≥–ª–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–º —è–∑—ã–∫–∞—Ö: —Å–∏–Ω—Ç–∞–∫—Å–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑ –∏ –ª–∏–Ω–≥–≤–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –∞—Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç—ã‚Äù[RU]/Frequency of different word orders in Russian and English: syntactic analysis and linguistic aspects[EN], which bridges theoretical linguistics and practical NLP applications. This research did not rely on machine learning but emphasized linguistic rule-based parsing and statistical analysis.
Currently, I am working on extending this project to include visualization of syntactic data on interactive maps, exploring GIS integration for spatial-linguistic representation, and incorporating basic statistical analysis (e.g., ANOVA) of syntactic tendencies. You can view this work in more detail in my portfolio entry.

üë©üèª‚Äçüî¨ Professional Experience
I am currently undergoing professional retraining in Computational Linguistics at the Higher School of Economics (HSE) in Moscow, where I am completing advanced courses in Python, R, mathematical statistics, corpus analysis, and machine learning.
Previously, I worked as a translator/interpreter and contributed to projects for the United Nations, including two initiatives involving GIS and cartographic data. In my bachelor‚Äôs thesis, I explored inclusive education, focusing on teaching children with cerebral palsy through fairy tales. I later published an article on this subject, supported by observations from an internship at an inclusive school.
These experiences have significantly shaped my current focus on computational language analysis, particularly in syntactic structure and word order, as well as rule-based and statistical NLP using Python and R. I‚Äôm also exploring how linguistic insights can be applied to the development of language learning tools.
